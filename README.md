# MemoryOpdracht_CSharp

This repository contains a C# memory game developed during my study: HBO-ICT for the semester Object Oriented Software Design & Development. 

The main goal of this assignment was to apply object oriented programming principles in a practical software project.

## Project context

This assignment was part of the HBO-ICT curriculum at Windesheim.  
The focus of the semester was on designing and developing software using object oriented principles such as encapsulation abstraction inheritance and polymorphism.

## Application description

The application is a memory game implemented in C#.  
Players flip cards and try to find matching pairs while the game logic manages state validation and progression.

The project emphasizes clean structure readability and separation of responsibilities.

## Learning objectives

During this project the following skills and concepts were practiced

1 Object oriented design and implementation  
2 Working with classes and objects  
3 Applying design principles in C#  
4 Structuring a small scale application  
5 Writing maintainable and readable code  

## Technologies used

1 C#  
2 .NET  
3 Visual Studio  

## How to run the project

1 Clone this repository  
2 Open the solution in Visual Studio  
3 Build the solution  
4 Run the application  

## Notes

This project was created for educational purposes and reflects the learning objectives of the course at that time.
