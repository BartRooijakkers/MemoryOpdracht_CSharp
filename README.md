# MemoryOpdracht_CSharp

This repository contains a small C# memory game developed during my HBO-ICT study for the semester **O**bject **O**riented **S**oftware **D**esign and **D**evelopment.

The goal of this assignment was to apply object oriented programming principles and core C# concepts in a practical software project.
	
## Project context

This assignment was part of the HBO-ICT curriculum at Windesheim.  
The focus of the semester was on designing and developing software using object oriented principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism.

In addition, the project was used to practice working with events and exceptions within a structured application.

## Application description

The application is a simple memory game implemented in C#.  
Players flip cards and try to find matching pairs while the game logic manages game state and progression.

The project focuses on clear structure, readability and separation of responsibilities.  
Events are used to handle game flow and state changes, while exceptions are used for validation and error handling.

The solution also includes a separate test project with unit tests for core game logic.

## Learning objectives

During this project the following skills and concepts were practiced

1. Object oriented design and implementation  
2. Working with classes and objects  
3. Using events to manage application flow  
4. Handling exceptions in a controlled way  
5. Structuring a small scale application  
6. Writing maintainable and readable code  

## Technologies used

1. C#  
2. .NET  
3. Visual Studio
4. xUnit  

## How to run the project

1. Clone this repository  
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio  
3. Build the solution  
4. Select a startup project and run the application  

## Notes

This project was developed as part of the Object Oriented Software Design and Development course.
